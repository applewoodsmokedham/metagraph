## Known Issues

### 1. Network Switching Race Condition
- Network switching can cause race conditions when switching rapidly between networks
- UI can display data from one network while showing a different network is selected
- This is a critical issue that undermines application reliability
- Resolving this issue is our current priority by implementing URL-based network architecture

### 2. Browser Compatibility
- Some Node.js features are not fully compatible with the browser environment
- Buffer implementation is limited and may not handle all cases
- File system operations are mocked and don't persist data

### 3. Error Handling
- Some error messages could be more user-friendly
- Error recovery could be improved in some components
- Network errors need better handling and retry mechanisms
- Wallet connection errors need specific handling

### 4. Performance
- Large result sets can cause performance issues
- Some API calls to mainnet can be slow
- No caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
- LaserEyesProvider may impact initial load time

### 5. UI/UX
- Loading states could be improved
- Form validation needs enhancement
- Mobile responsiveness needs improvement
- Some links may not work correctly if routes are not properly defined
- Wallet selection UI could be enhanced with wallet icons

### 6. Wallet Integration
- Not all wallets may be available in all browsers
- Some wallets may have specific requirements or limitations
- Error handling for wallet-specific issues needs improvement
- Network alignment between METAGRAPH and wallet providers needs testing

19. **Removed Mock Data**: Successfully removed all mock data from the application and implemented real data fetching through the Oyl SDK.

20. **Browser Compatibility**: Implemented a comprehensive Node.js compatibility layer that allows the Oyl SDK to run in a browser environment.

## Next Priorities

1. **Implement URL-based Network Architecture**: Build the NetworkProvider and NetworkNav components, update the route configuration, and adapt existing pages to use network from URL parameters to eliminate the race condition issue.

2. **Enhance SDK with AbortController Support**: Update SDK functions to support request cancellation with AbortController to prevent race conditions during network changes.

3. **Implement Redirect Logic**: Create redirects from old URL patterns to new ones to maintain backward compatibility during the transition.

4. **Enhance Wallet Functionality**: Expand wallet functionality to include transaction history, balance display, and transaction sending interface.

5. **Implement Additional API Methods**: Complete the implementation of the remaining API methods from the method matrix.

6. **Enhance User Experience**: Improve navigation between method pages, add more interactive examples, and implement better error handling and feedback.

7. **Complete Integration Testing**: Test all API methods and wallet functionality with real data across different network environments.
